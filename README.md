# Software Design Document

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room, the client, wanted to develop a web-based version of their existing game, Draw It or Lose It. This game is currently only available on Android, and the Gaming Room aims to expand across multiple platforms.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In developing this documentation, I did particularly well in the evaluation section by providing a thorough analysis of various operating platforms and their compatibility with the gaming application's requirements. I meticulously assessed the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each platform, considering factors such as development tools, memory management, and client-side considerations. This comprehensive evaluation aids in making informed decisions that align the project with the client's needs and sets a solid foundation for successful software development.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through a design document was helpful in structuring my thoughts and planning the software development process. It enabled me to foresee potential challenges, identify key requirements, and establish a clear roadmap for the code's implementation.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part on this document to revise it would be the memory mangement section. I would elaborate more on the virtual strategies and they are related to the game's requirements and any potential challenges. To demonstrate how effective memory allocation, deallocation, and garbage collection aid in reducing memory leaks and enhancing game performance, I would include more real-world instances or scenarios.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting the user's needs involved understanding the client's vision, requirements, and goals. It was crucial to align the software design with these needs to ensure a solution that meets user expectations. Considering the user's needs is vital, as it directly impacts user satisfaction and the success of the software.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the software design by meticulously aligning it with the client's needs, as outlined in the requirements and design constraints. By understanding the client's desire to expand their game to multiple platforms and enhance user engagement, I crafted a design that utilized web-based technologies for cross-platform compatibility and incorporated team-based gameplay. This user-centric approach ensured that the software met the client's objectives and adhered to their vision, laying the groundwork for a successful application design. In future software design endeavors, I will employ several key techniques and strategies. I would create detailed use case scenarios and flowcharts to visualize the user interactions and system processes. Utilizing design patterns and principles would help ensure a structured and modular architecture. Staying update on the latest technological advancements would contribute to a robust and forward-looking software design.
